# 🌟 High-Value / Low-Effort Enhancements (Aura Project List)

These are world-class, battle-tested features that can be added to the `static-landing` template to achieve "The Golden Path" of modern web standards.

## 🛠️ Developer Experience (DX) & Code Quality
1.  **Standardize: `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`**
    *   *Value*: Automatically sorts all Tailwind classes in Astro components.
    *   *Effort*: Low (5 min setup).
    *   *Impact*: Ensures that every developer on the S&S team follows the same class ordering rules.
2.  **Lint: `astro-check`**
    *   *Value*: Adds a "Type-Checking" layer for Astro files in CI.
    *   *Effort*: Low (npx command + 5 min setup).
    *   *Impact*: Catches 0.1% runtime errors early.

## 🚀 Performance & SEO
1.  **Optimize: `Astro Compress`**
    *   *Value*: One-line plugin to minify HTML, CSS, JS, and Images at build.
    *   *Effort*: Low (npm install + 2 lines in `astro.config.mjs`).
    *   *Impact*: Significant Lighthouse score boost for "Production-Ready" claims.
2.  **Generate: `Astro Sitemap` & `RobotsTxt`**
    *   *Value*: Auto-generates SEO-critical files.
    *   *Effort*: Low (Astro official integrations).
    *   *Impact*: "World-class" baseline for search engine indexing.

## 🎨 User Experience (UX) & Interactions
1.  **Premium: `Astro View Transitions`**
    *   *Value*: Enables mobile-like slide/fade transitions between pages without a SPA framework.
    *   *Effort*: Low (built-in to Astro, 2 lines of code).
    *   *Impact*: Gives the `seedsource.dev` site that "expensive" technical-blueprint feel.
2.  **Adaptive: `Sync Dark/Light Themes`**
    *   *Value*: Sync the active semantic theme to the user's OS preference (`prefers-color-scheme`).
    *   *Effort*: Low (small CSS media query in `themes.css`).
    *   *Impact*: Immediate user comfort and modern standard alignment.

## 📦 Architecture & Scaling
1.  **Decouple: `Blueprint Live-Reload`**
    *   *Value*: A "Development-only" side-nav that lets you toggle themes and text live.
    *   *Effort*: Medium (1 hour).
    *   *Impact*: Massive sales value for `sscli` users to preview their landing page before build.
2.  **Presets: `Deployment Adapters` (Vercel/Netlify/Docker)**
    *   *Value*: Pre-configured adapters for Astro.
    *   *Effort*: Low.
    *   *Impact*: "One-click deploy" documentation for all S&S projects.
